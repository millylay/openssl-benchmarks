Prep:
	This will take a while to run.

	You may want to mount /tmp as ramfs,
	as we're going to be building every OpenSSL
	version and then running the built-in benchmark.

	Sudo access is preferred but not required.

Execution

	1. Fork https://github.com/rsaxvc/openssl-benchmarks
	2. Clone your tasty new repo
	3. On mostly idle system, run ./benchmark.sh
		Note: sudo is used to set the CPU governor
		and the 'nice' value to '-20', then changes back
		to your user. If you don't have sudo access, or
		just plain don't want to, you can run
		./benchmark.1.sh instead, but your results may
		be suboptimal.
	4. `git push` to your repo.
	5. Create pull request.

Privacy:This tool will log hostname, openssl performance,
	CPU and memory information. See
	"capture some machine information" in benchmark.1.sh
	for the complete list, or see the 'machine'
	directory in the output folder.
